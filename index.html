	<h2>Instructions</h2>
		
		<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p> 
		
		<p>You should play this game because it is proven that there has been a significant increase in cognitive ability and acuity from just playing 15 minutes a day.<p>
